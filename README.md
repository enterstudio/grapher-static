# grapher-static

This is a static production bundle of the embedded interactive charts and data on https://ourworldindata.org/, generated from our database and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This contains charts and data generated by [owid-grapher](https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher) only, the rest of the site content is in [wp-static](https://github.com/owid/wp-static).

**Don't send pull requests to this repository.** It's only an export, so the changes would get overridden. Eventually it'd be great if we could accept pull requests, but we need to migrate away from MySQL first.
