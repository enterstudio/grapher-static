Data gathered using monthly reports from a sample of establishments since 1932. Jones' historical series takes the data from the BLS and performs downward adjustments of the BLS observations necessitated by the introduction of a number of employer pay practices. In 1943, employers began to compensate workers in bituminous and anthracite industries for the hours spent travelling in the mine shaft opening to the place of work within the time. Travel time within the mine is included in average work hours when it is paid for, and excluded when it is not. Employee coverage is limited to production workers.","created_at":"2018-06-28T12:37:57.000Z","updated_at":"2018-06-28T12:37:57.000Z","uploaded_at":"2018-06-28T12:37:57.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":2825,"variableTypeId":3,"sourceId":15556,"uploaded_by":"Diana","display":{},"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"New estimates of hours of work per week, 1900-1957 - Jones (1963)","s_id":15556,"s_name":"Jones (1963)","source":{"id":15556,"name":"Jones (1963)","dataPublishedBy":"Jones, E.B., 1963.
