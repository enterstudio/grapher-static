This is measured as the number of abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years old.\n\nThe authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.\n\nData was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. \"1994\" denotes the period 1990-1994; \"1999\" denotes 1995-1999; [...], \"2014\" denotes 2010-2014."}}},"entityKey":{"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"275":{"name":"Asia","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"277":{"name":"Oceania","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"295":{"name":"South America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"436":{"name":"Caribbean","code":null},"462":{"name":"Eastern Africa","code":null},"463":{"name":"Middle Africa","code":null},"464":{"name":"Northern Africa","code":null},"465":{"name":"Southern Africa","code":null},"466":{"name":"Western Africa","code":null},"467":{"name":"Eastern Asia","code":null},"472":{"name":"Western Asia","code":null},"473":{"name":"Eastern Europe","code":null},"474":{"name":"Northern Europe","code":null},"475":{"name":"Southern Europe","code":null},"476":{"name":"Western Europe","code":null},"477":{"name":"Central America","code":null},"5403":{"name":"Latin America","code":null},"5406":{"name":"Developing countries","code":null},"5407":{"name":"Developed countries","code":null},"34834":{"name":"Southeastern Asia","code":null},"37725":{"name":"South and Central Asia","code":null}}}
