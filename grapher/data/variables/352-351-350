And in footnote they say ‘these definitions correspond to poverty lines equal to consumption per capita of $2 and $1 a day, expressed in 1985 PPP.’\r\n\r\nTo this I added the share of people living living below the international poverty line which, since the revision in 2015, is $1.90 at 2011 purchasing-power parity (PPP). The revisions in the definition of the poverty line and the PPP adjustment make the poverty figures in levels not comparable to earlier data – to illustrate this I have plotted both series for the time from 1981 to 1992. The World Bank data was downloaded in October 2015."}}}}
