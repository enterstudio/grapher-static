Data on literacy rates come from a variety of sources (such as national censuses and surveys) and reporting modes (self-reporting vs household declarations). \r\n\r\nData instruments used to estimate literacy are grouped under three main types: i) a census; ii) a survey; or iii) indirect estimates. Indirect estimates are extrapolated - based on educational attainment, or estimated based on the country's census.\r\n\r\nMethodologies used for measuring literacy have been grouped into four categories: household declarations, self declarations, literacy tests, and national estimates. Both household and self-declared literacy are self-reports; in the former, it is the head of the household responding to the survey, and in the latter it is directly reported by the individuals themselves.\r\n\r\nUNESCO categorised Chile's (2009) and the Philippines' (2003) mode of literacy reporting as 'Household/Self declaration'. We have categorised the two countries under the household declaration category."}}}}
