[Please see table 2 on page 20]\r\n\r\nCatling’s study of The Spinning Mule provides a historical introduction of the invention of the spinning mule in the 18th century. The spinning mule was worked by hand with the spinner manually controlled all its operations. It was around 1825 that Richard Roberts invented the ‘quadrant winding motion’ that enabled the machine to operate automatically.\r\n\r\nFull reference: Chapman, S.D., 1987.
