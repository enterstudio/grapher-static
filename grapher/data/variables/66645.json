It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: \n \n[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and \nenvironmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution \nA/RES/62/98) \n \nThe indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of \nsustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators \nfocused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance \nof biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of \nforests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-\nindicator provides further qualification to management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are \nindependently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. \n \nThe sub-indicators are: \n\nForest area net change rate  \n\n \n  Above-ground biomass stock in forest \n  Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas \n  Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan \n \n\nForest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme \n\n \nA dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard \napproach provides for clear view of areas where progress towards sustainable development goals has \nbeen achieved.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully \ncover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are poorly \n\n\freflected in the current set of sub-indicators. Furthermore, there are some data gaps, and the trends of \nsome of the sub-indicators reflect different sets of countries. While the dashboard illustrates the progress \non the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n
