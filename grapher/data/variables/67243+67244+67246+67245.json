It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how \nmany times reporting would be required prior to 2030.

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Stockholm Convention); \n4.  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol); \n5.  Minamata Convention on Mercury (Minamata Convention), \n\n \n\nWhich  have  submitted  the  information  to  the  Secretariat  of  each  MEA,  as  required  by  each  of  the \nagreements.  \n \nThe information required is as follows: \n \nBasel Convention1: \n\n1.  Designation of the Focal Point and one or more Competent Authorities; \n2.  Submission of the annual national reports. \n\n \n\nRotterdam Convention: \n\n1.

Other information that only needs to be communicated to the Secretariat based on \nnational circumstances, such  as a possible national definitions of hazardous wastes, possible article 11 agreements under \nthe Basel Convention, or a possible exemptions under the  Stockholm Convention would not be included, either because \nthe  Secretariat  is  not  in  a  position  to  assess  whether  the  obligation  to  transmit  information  has  materialized  itself,  or \nbecause Parties have the right not to make use of a right. \n\n\f2.

Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nThe transmission of information as required by the five Conventions follows a different timing. This is the \nreason  why  the  reporting  to  this  indicator  has  been  scheduled  for  5-year  cycles,  which  would  allow \ncapturing the compliance of Parties with the transmission of information of all the Conventions. \n \nPlease  also  note  that  the  timing  for  submission  of  reporting  for  the  Minamata  Convention  has  not  yet \nbeen agreed on. It is not clear whether any reporting will be required prior to 2020, nor it is clear how \nmany times reporting would be required prior to 2030. Thus, the Minamata Convention is included here, \nbut the reporting is subject to further decisions on this. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n\n1.  Basel Conventions: 185 Parties; \n2.
