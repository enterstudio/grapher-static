The term also includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The pesticides are classified according to: (a) the type of activity/target organism (e.g. fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, rodenticides and etc.) and (b) the chemical nature (e.g. organophosphates, pyrethroids). The classification adopted in the Pesticide (use) database is organized as follows: 1. INSECTICIDES (Chlorinated hydrocarbons, Organo phosphates, Carbamates, insecticides, Pyrethroids, Botanical and biological products and Others not elsewhere classified ); 2. MINERAL OILS; 3. HERBICIDES (Phenoxy hormone products, Triazines, Amides, Carbamates, herbicides, Dinitroanilines, Urea derivatives, Sulfonyl urea, Bipiridils, Uracil, Others not elsewhere classified); 4. FUNGICIDES AND BACTERICIDES (Inorganic, Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Others not elsewhere classified); 5. SEED TREATMENT, FUNGICIDES (Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Botanical products and biological, Others not elsewhere classified); 6.

The term also includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The pesticides are classified according to: (a) the type of activity/target organism (e.g. fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, rodenticides and etc.) and (b) the chemical nature (e.g. organophosphates, pyrethroids). The classification adopted in the Pesticide (use) database is organized as follows: 1. INSECTICIDES (Chlorinated hydrocarbons, Organo phosphates, Carbamates, insecticides, Pyrethroids, Botanical and biological products and Others not elsewhere classified ); 2. MINERAL OILS; 3. HERBICIDES (Phenoxy hormone products, Triazines, Amides, Carbamates, herbicides, Dinitroanilines, Urea derivatives, Sulfonyl urea, Bipiridils, Uracil, Others not elsewhere classified); 4. FUNGICIDES AND BACTERICIDES (Inorganic, Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Others not elsewhere classified); 5. SEED TREATMENT, FUNGICIDES (Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Botanical products and biological, Others not elsewhere classified); 6.

The term also includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The pesticides are classified according to: (a) the type of activity/target organism (e.g. fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, rodenticides and etc.) and (b) the chemical nature (e.g. organophosphates, pyrethroids). The classification adopted in the Pesticide (use) database is organized as follows: 1. INSECTICIDES (Chlorinated hydrocarbons, Organo phosphates, Carbamates, insecticides, Pyrethroids, Botanical and biological products and Others not elsewhere classified ); 2. MINERAL OILS; 3. HERBICIDES (Phenoxy hormone products, Triazines, Amides, Carbamates, herbicides, Dinitroanilines, Urea derivatives, Sulfonyl urea, Bipiridils, Uracil, Others not elsewhere classified); 4. FUNGICIDES AND BACTERICIDES (Inorganic, Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Others not elsewhere classified); 5. SEED TREATMENT, FUNGICIDES (Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Botanical products and biological, Others not elsewhere classified); 6.

The term also includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The pesticides are classified according to: (a) the type of activity/target organism (e.g. fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, rodenticides and etc.) and (b) the chemical nature (e.g. organophosphates, pyrethroids). The classification adopted in the Pesticide (use) database is organized as follows: 1. INSECTICIDES (Chlorinated hydrocarbons, Organo phosphates, Carbamates, insecticides, Pyrethroids, Botanical and biological products and Others not elsewhere classified ); 2. MINERAL OILS; 3. HERBICIDES (Phenoxy hormone products, Triazines, Amides, Carbamates, herbicides, Dinitroanilines, Urea derivatives, Sulfonyl urea, Bipiridils, Uracil, Others not elsewhere classified); 4. FUNGICIDES AND BACTERICIDES (Inorganic, Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Others not elsewhere classified); 5. SEED TREATMENT, FUNGICIDES (Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Botanical products and biological, Others not elsewhere classified); 6.

The term also includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The pesticides are classified according to: (a) the type of activity/target organism (e.g. fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, rodenticides and etc.) and (b) the chemical nature (e.g. organophosphates, pyrethroids). The classification adopted in the Pesticide (use) database is organized as follows: 1. INSECTICIDES (Chlorinated hydrocarbons, Organo phosphates, Carbamates, insecticides, Pyrethroids, Botanical and biological products and Others not elsewhere classified ); 2. MINERAL OILS; 3. HERBICIDES (Phenoxy hormone products, Triazines, Amides, Carbamates, herbicides, Dinitroanilines, Urea derivatives, Sulfonyl urea, Bipiridils, Uracil, Others not elsewhere classified); 4. FUNGICIDES AND BACTERICIDES (Inorganic, Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Others not elsewhere classified); 5. SEED TREATMENT, FUNGICIDES (Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Botanical products and biological, Others not elsewhere classified); 6.

The term also includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. The pesticides are classified according to: (a) the type of activity/target organism (e.g. fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, rodenticides and etc.) and (b) the chemical nature (e.g. organophosphates, pyrethroids). The classification adopted in the Pesticide (use) database is organized as follows: 1. INSECTICIDES (Chlorinated hydrocarbons, Organo phosphates, Carbamates, insecticides, Pyrethroids, Botanical and biological products and Others not elsewhere classified ); 2. MINERAL OILS; 3. HERBICIDES (Phenoxy hormone products, Triazines, Amides, Carbamates, herbicides, Dinitroanilines, Urea derivatives, Sulfonyl urea, Bipiridils, Uracil, Others not elsewhere classified); 4. FUNGICIDES AND BACTERICIDES (Inorganic, Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Others not elsewhere classified); 5. SEED TREATMENT, FUNGICIDES (Dithiocarbamates, Benzimidazoles, Triazoles Diazoles, Diazines Morpholines, Botanical products and biological, Others not elsewhere classified); 6. SEED TREATMENT INSECTICIDES (Organo-phosphates, Carbamates insecticides, Pyrethroids, Others not elsewhere classified); 7. PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS; 8. RODENTICIDES (Anti coagulants, Cyanide Generators, Hypercalcaemics, Narcotics, Others not elsewhere classified); 9. OTHER PESTICIDES NES (not elsewhere specified); 10. DISINFECTANTS.\r\n\r\n"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
