It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: \n \n[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and \nenvironmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution \nA/RES/62/98) \n \nThe indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of \nsustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators \nfocused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance \nof biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of \nforests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-\nindicator provides further qualification to management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are \nindependently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. \n \nThe sub-indicators are: \n\nForest area net change rate  \n\n \n  Above-ground biomass stock in forest \n  Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas \n  Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan \n \n\nForest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme \n\n \nA dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard \napproach provides for clear view of areas where progress towards sustainable development goals has \nbeen achieved.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully \ncover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are poorly \n\n\freflected in the current set of sub-indicators. Furthermore, there are some data gaps, and the trends of \nsome of the sub-indicators reflect different sets of countries. While the dashboard illustrates the progress \non the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n   Breakdown of the number of countries covered by region and by sub-indicator is as follows: \n \n\n \n\nTotal number of countries / territoriesForest area change rateBiomass stockForest area within legally protected areasForest area under management planForest area under an an independently verified forest management certification schemeForest area change rateBiomass stockForest area within legally protected areasForest area under management planForest area under an an independently verified forest management certification schemeWorld234234176162121234100%75%69%52%100%Africa585852484058100%90%83%69%100%Northern Africa777557100%100%71%71%100%Sub-Saharan Africa515145433551100%88%84%69%100%Eastern Africa202016181020100%80%90%50%100%Middle Africa999779100%100%78%78%100%Southern Africa555545100%100%100%80%100%Western Africa171715131417100%88%76%82%100%Americas535329351753100%55%66%32%100%Latin America and the Caribbean484827321548100%56%67%31%100%Caribbean2626911526100%35%42%19%100%Latin America222218211022100%82%95%45%100%Northern America552325100%40%60%40%100%Asia484836302348100%75%63%48%100%Central Asia555335100%100%60%60%100%Eastern Asia553445100%60%80%80%100%Southern Asia998549100%89%56%44%100%South-Eastern Asia111199411100%82%82%36%100%Western Asia1818119818100%61%50%44%100%Europe505044383450100%88%76%68%100%Eastern Europe1010109910100%100%90%90%100%Northern Europe151511101015100%73%67%67%100%Southern Europe16161412816100%88%75%50%100%Western Europe999779100%100%78%78%100%Oceania25251511725100%60%44%28%100%Australia and New Zealand331223100%33%67%67%100%Melanesia553325100%60%60%40%100%Micronesia776117100%86%14%14%100%Polynesia101055210100%50%50%20%100%Number of countries reporting latest yearRegionNumber of countries reporting latest year (%)\f \nTime series: \n \n1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"277":{"name":"Oceania","code":null},"289":{"name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","code":null},"295":{"name":"South America","code":null},"343":{"name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"436":{"name":"Caribbean","code":null},"450":{"name":"Northern America","code":null},"454":{"name":"Least developed countries","code":null},"462":{"name":"Eastern Africa","code":null},"463":{"name":"Middle Africa","code":null},"464":{"name":"Northern Africa","code":null},"465":{"name":"Southern Africa","code":null},"466":{"name":"Western Africa","code":null},"467":{"name":"Eastern Asia","code":null},"469":{"name":"Central Asia","code":null},"471":{"name":"South-Eastern Asia","code":null},"472":{"name":"Western Asia","code":null},"473":{"name":"Eastern Europe","code":null},"474":{"name":"Northern Europe","code":null},"475":{"name":"Southern Europe","code":null},"476":{"name":"Western Europe","code":null},"477":{"name":"Central America","code":null},"478":{"name":"Melanesia","code":"OWID_MNS"},"479":{"name":"Polynesia","code":"OWID_PYA"},"5398":{"name":"Small island developing States","code":null},"5404":{"name":"Landlocked developing countries","code":null},"34752":{"name":"Micronesia (region)","code":null},"36415":{"name":"Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)","code":null},"36416":{"name":"Australia and New Zealand","code":null},"36458":{"name":"Europe and Northern America","code":null},"36460":{"name":"Central and Southern Asia","code":null},"36461":{"name":"Eastern and South-Eastern Asia","code":null},"36463":{"name":"Northern Africa and Western Asia","code":null}}}
