developing countries in international organizations has \ntwo components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country \nproportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two components are \nidentical. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated

developing countries in international organizations has \ntwo components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country \nproportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two components are \nidentical. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated

developing countries in international organizations has \ntwo components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country \nproportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two components are \nidentical. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCross institutional comparisons needs to pay attention to the different membership of the institutions. \nVoting rights and membership in their institutions are agreed by the Member States themselves. As a \nstructural indicator, there will be only small changes over time to reflect agreement on new States joining \nas Members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated
