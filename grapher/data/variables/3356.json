Contraceptive prevalence rates are obtained mainly from household surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and contraceptive prevalence surveys. Unmarried women are often excluded from such surveys, which may bias the estimates.\n"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
