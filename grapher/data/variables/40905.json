A qualified teacher is one who has the minimum academic qualifications necessary to teach at a specific level of education in a given country. This is usually related to the subject(s) they teach. The percentage of qualified teachers should not exceed 100%. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers should be converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ numbers of teachers; a double-shift teacher should be counted twice, etc. Ideally, all staff involved in direct classroom-teaching roles should be included in the calculations. High values indicate that students are being taught by teachers who are academically well qualified in the subjects they teach.","created_at":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T08:58:51.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","code":"UIS.QUTP.02","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":886,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":5411,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5411,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in pre-primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5411,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in pre-primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"18":{"name":"Andorra","code":"AND"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"27":{"name":"Bahrain","code":"BHR"},"29":{"name":"Barbados","code":"BRB"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"36":{"name":"Botswana","code":"BWA"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"41":{"name":"Burundi","code":"BDI"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"45":{"name":"Cape Verde","code":"CPV"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"93":{"name":"Puerto Rico","code":"PRI"},"98":{"name":"Paraguay","code":"PRY"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"110":{"name":"Morocco","code":"MAR"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"123":{"name":"Lesotho","code":"LSO"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"157":{"name":"Eritrea","code":"ERI"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"194":{"name":"Bermuda","code":"BMU"},"195":{"name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SLB"},"206":{"name":"Grenada","code":"GRD"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"211":{"name":"Maldives","code":"MDV"},"217":{"name":"Oman","code":"OMN"},"218":{"name":"Nauru","code":"NRU"},"221":{"name":"Vanuatu","code":"VUT"},"224":{"name":"Palau","code":"PLW"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"227":{"name":"Saint Kitts and Nevis","code":"KNA"},"233":{"name":"Seychelles","code":"SYC"},"234":{"name":"Suriname","code":"SUR"},"237":{"name":"Tuvalu","code":"TUV"},"239":{"name":"Samoa","code":"WSM"},"262":{"name":"Macao","code":"MAC"}}}
