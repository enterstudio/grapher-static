In order to better understand alcohol consumption, we need to combine this information with other information on who drinks and in what pattern. The number of alcohol consumers in the past 12 months provides such information by separating out the drinking from the non-drinking population.\n\nDefinition\nAlcohol consumers in the past 12 months is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have consumed any alcohol during the past 12 months, assessed at a given point in time. The indicator is calculated with the help of the indicator \"Abstainers (15+ years), past 12 months\" by using 1-abstainers.\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nPopulation-based surveys\n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\nA representative sample of the adult population (15+ years) of the country is asked to answer questions in a survey. The first priority in the decision tree is given to international surveys (in this order of preference: WHS, STEPS, GENACIS, and ECAS); second is national surveys.\n\nMethod of estimation\nStatistical
