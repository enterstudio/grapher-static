Its user friendliness and \nsmooth learning curve make it a perfect tool for performing fast, accurate and cost-effective \nassessments. It is free, open source and highly customizable for the specific data collection needs and \nmethodologies. It builds upon very high resolution multi-temporal images from Google Earth and Bing \nMaps and Landsat 7 and 8 datasets from Google Earth Engine. Data and images are stored and globally \navailable for any year from 2000, making possible the monitoring of the change over time.  \n \nThe indicator has a global accuracy of 99%, but at national level for small countries the degree of \naccuracy is lower. This will be improved over time as more countries expand the data collection within \ntheir territory.  \n \nData on mountain coverage are provided by the 2015 FAO/MPS global map of mountains. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nAll \n \n"}}}}
