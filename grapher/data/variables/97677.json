These thresholds are defined by level of education (primary or secondary) and by subject (maths, science, and reading). \n\nPrimary education thresholds are defined by PIRLS and TIMSS at scores of 400 (minimum threshold) , 475 (intermediate threshold), and 625 (advanced threshold) across all subjects. Secondary education thresholds are defined using PISA at scores of roughly 400, 475, and over 600, varying by subject.  For more information on thresholds used by level of education and subject, see Table 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 in the original paper.\n\nFor four observations, Germany (1970, 1980), Italy (1980), and China (1990), the percentage of students reaching the intermediate threshold was entered as 0%, while in neighbouring years the share of students reaching the intermediate threshold was much higher. These four observations have been coded as missing."}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
