Population Division (2017) and US Census Bureau.\r\n\r\nAbsolute differences measure the absolute difference in regional and global population estimates from the UN Population Division and US Census Bureau. Figures were calculated as the annual total population estimate from the UN Population Division (2017) minus population estimates from the US Census Bureau.\r\n\r\nRelative differences measure this difference in estimates as a percentage of UN figures (i.e. (UN population - US Census Bureau population) / UN population).\r\n\r\nNegative figures therefore represent lower UN estimates vs. US Census Bureau estimates, and vice versa (positive values indicate higher UN estimates).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nUnited Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017).
