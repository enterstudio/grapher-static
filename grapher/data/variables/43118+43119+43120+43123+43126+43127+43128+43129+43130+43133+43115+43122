For instance, wildlife reserves can generate significant revenues for developing countries in particular from international tourism activities. And about one-third of the worldâ€™s big cities get their drinking water from sources in or downstream of protected areas, saving billions of dollars in supply and treatment costs thanks to forests and wetlands that regulate the flow of water and remove contaminants (Dudley et al 2010). Valuing such ecosystem services on a global basis, however, is difficult. For this reason, protected areas are valued in the World Bank wealth accounts using a simplified approach. Under this approach, the quasi-opportunity cost of protection per unit area of land contained in terrestrial protected areas is estimated as the lower of returns to cropland and pastureland. This is likely to be a lower bound on the true value of protected areas. Returns are capitalized over an infinite time horizon. The World Bank bases calculations on a number of its own databases and indicators.","created_at":"2017-11-09T10:02:37.000Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T10:02:37.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-11-09T10:02:37.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"Global by country groupings","timespan":"1995-2014","fk_dst_id":1029,"fk_var_type_id":3,"sourceId":6889,"uploaded_by":"SandraTz","displayIsProjection":null,"displayName":null,"displayShortUnit":null,"displayTolerance":null,"displayUnit":null,"displayUnitConversionFactor":null,"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"Wealth per capita by component for various country groupings - World Bank (2017)","s_id":6889,"s_name":"World Bank (2017)","source":{"id":6889,"name":"World Bank (2017)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank","dataPublisherSource":"The World Bank used various sources to calculate wealth values, see each variable for more detail.","link":"","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}},"43122":{"id":43122,"name":"Cropland","unit":"$","description":"The value of cropland is calculated as the present value of returns to the land.
