It is not \nwell-defined. We propose to use the following indicator, similar but well-defined: “Average total cost of \nsending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency, adjusted for inflation) in each country corridor \n(expressed as % of amount sent).” This indicator is readily available for a total of 365 country corridors \nworldwide, for 48 sending and 105 receiving countries on a quarterly basis by the World Bank’s \nRemittance Prices Worldwide database. Data availability information above is based on the 105 receiving \ncountries.   \n \nComments and limitations: \nRPW data does not include information on fees charged to remittance receivers. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nThe data are available for 365 corridors, which include 48 sending countries and 105 receiving countries. \nThe data are collected quarterly.  \n \nTime series: \nData availability: since Q1 2008 (online in Excel format since Q1 2011).  \n \n"}}}}
