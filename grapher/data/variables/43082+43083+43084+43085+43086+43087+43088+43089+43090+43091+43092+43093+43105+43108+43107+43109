All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nGDP: measures total gross domestic product in constant 2010 US$ (adjusted for inflation). Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nCereal yield: based on the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) variable, \"Cereal yield (hectares)\". Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nAgricultural area: represents total agricultural area which is the combination of arable land, permanent crops and pasture/grazing land. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL\n\nCropland: represents arable land area. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL\n\nCaloric supply: represents the caloric supply available for food consumption. Derived by multiplying the UN FAO's variable \"Food supply quantity (kcal/capita/day) by global population figures, as published by the UN Population Division. Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\n\nMeat production: measures total meat production (all types). Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\n\nFreshwater use: represents annual freshwater withdrawals for agriculture, industry and municipal uses. Data published by the Global International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGB). Available at: \thttp://www.igbp.net/globalchange/greatacceleration.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680001630.html\n\nCOâ‚‚ emissions: measures carbon dioxide emissions from energy and manufacturing output. Data published by the World Bank's World Development Indicators. Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?view=chart\n\nEnergy use: represents primary energy production (excluding traditional biofuel use). Data published by the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2016. Available at: http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n\nFishery catch: represents the total capture fisheries (wild) production measures the volume of fish catches landed by a country for all commercial, industrial, recreational and subsistence purposes. Data published by the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) variable, \"Capture Fisheries Production (metric tons)\". Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nAquaculture: Aquaculture is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Aquaculture production specifically refers to output from aquaculture activities, which are designated for final harvest for consumption. Data published by the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) variable, \"Aquaculture Production (metric tons)\". Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nFertilizer production: the sum of nitrogenous, phosphorous and potash fertilizer production, based on data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RA\n\nCoal, oil and natural gas consumption:  Data published by the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2016.
