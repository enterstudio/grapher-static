This was developed by the FAO in 2014 and developed across 140 countries.\n\nThe FEIS measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity. \n\nFull information on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) can be found at: http://www.fao.org/3/a-as583e.pdf"}}}}
