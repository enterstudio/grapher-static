The definition relates directly to \n\n“public access to information”, which is wider than, but is also very much based upon, the established \n\nfundamental freedoms of expression and association. Conversely, these freedoms also both impact on \n\nthe environment for public access to information.  \n\n \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n \n\nThis indicator does not assess the totality of “public access to information” component of the full Target \n\nof 16.10. Nevertheless, it focusses on a key determinant of the wider information environment. \n\n \n\n\f\nData Availability \n\n \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\nData on the existence of freedom of information laws are available for at least 195 countries. However, \n\nfor future data collection and analysis, efforts are underway to ensure that the data is analyzed to yield \n\ninformation on aspects relating to how FOI laws are actually \"implemented\", rather than just their \n\nexistence. \n\n \n\n"}}}}
