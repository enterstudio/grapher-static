In fact, as explained below, the six world regions do not take into account high-income countries.\nPovcalNet provides regional aggregation using 2011 PPPs and $1.90/day poverty line for reference years 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nUnfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed. Therefore, OWID team calculated the number of the missing variable subtracting the sum of the observed regions from the World Total. For example, dis-aggregated data is not available for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in 2013:\n\nMENA 2013 = World Total - (East Asia and Pacific + Europe and Central Asia + Latin America and the Caribbean + South Asia + Sub-Saharan Africa).\n\nWarning:\nThe most recent figures from the MENA reason do not necessarily reflect the geopolitical turmoil in the region.\n\nHigh-income countries are not included in PovcalNet tables used for this calculations."}}},"entityKey":{"289":{"name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","code":null},"300":{"name":"Europe and Central Asia","code":null},"301":{"name":"Middle East and North Africa","code":null},"302":{"name":"South Asia","code":null},"342":{"name":"East Asia and Pacific","code":null},"343":{"name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"}}}
