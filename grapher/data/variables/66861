For almost 60 percent of all reported breeds, risk \nstatus is not known because of missing population data or lack of recent updates. \n \nGenerally, data collection should be possible in all countries. Updating of population size data at least \neach 10 years is needed for the definition of the risk classes. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nSee the biannually reports to the Commission of Genetic Resources of Food and Agriculture.
