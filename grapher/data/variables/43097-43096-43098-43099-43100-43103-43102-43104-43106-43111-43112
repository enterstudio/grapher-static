All data represents average per capita figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nData was calculated either based on:\n(1) sources which originally reported data on a per capita basis, or;\n(2) by dividing sources in total absolute terms by UN Population Division estimates of total population. Where figures were based on dividing by population figures, UN estimates were derived from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nSources of data for the metrics were as follows:\n\nGDP: measures total gross domestic product per capita in constant 2011 international-$ (adjusted for inflation and cross-country differences). Data published at OurWorldinData and presents a combination of New Maddison Project Database and World Bank, World Development Indicators (WDI). Available at: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-over-the-long-run-MaddisonAndWorldBank\n\nAgricultural area: represents total agricultural area which is the combination of arable land, permanent crops and pasture/grazing land. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL\n\nCropland: represents arable land area. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL\n\nCaloric supply: represents the caloric supply available for food consumption. Data based on the UN FAO's variable \"Food supply quantity (kcal/capita/day)\". Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\n\nMeat consumption: measures total meat consumption (all types), per person per year. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\n\nFreshwater use: represents annual freshwater withdrawals for agriculture, industry and municipal uses. Data published by the Global International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGB). Available at:http://www.igbp.net/globalchange/greatacceleration.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680001630.html\n\nCO₂ emissions: based on data published by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC). Available at: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/CO2_Emission/\n\nEnergy use: represents primary energy production (excluding traditional biofuel use). Data published by the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2016. Available at: http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n\nFishery catch: represents the total capture fisheries (wild) production measures the volume of fish catches landed by a country for all commercial, industrial, recreational and subsistence purposes. Data published by the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) variable, \"Capture Fisheries Production (metric tons)\". Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nAquaculture: Aquaculture is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Aquaculture production specifically refers to output from aquaculture activities, which are designated for final harvest for consumption. Data published by the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) variable, \"Aquaculture Production (metric tons)\". Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nFertilizer production: the sum of nitrogenous, phosphorous and potash fertilizer production, based on data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RA\n\nCoal, oil and natural gas consumption:  Data published by the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2016.
