Progress \n\nof  developed  countries  in  implementing  development  effectiveness  commitments  is  captured  through \n\ntheir  partnership  behaviour  in  those  developing  countries.  Depending  on  each  case,  middle  income \n\ncountries  that  currently  are  both  recipient  and  providers  of  development  cooperation  opt  to  report  in \n\ntheir role as recipient and/or provider of development cooperation. Other developing and/or developed \n\ncountries could be included through their future participation in the OECD and UNDP data collection, or \n\nthough their reporting to complementary monitoring frameworks on a regular basis. \n\n\f \n\nData Availability \n\n \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\n\f\"Global  aggregates  are  available  for  the  2006,  2008,  and  2011  surveys  on  monitoring  the  Paris \n\nDeclaration  on Aid  Effectiveness,  as  well  as  the  2013  2014  GPEDC  monitoring  exercise.
