This is measured across the top 10 common malignancies in adults (aged 15-99), and leukaemia in children (aged 0-14). This share is age-standardized assuming a constant age distribution of the population to compare between countries and with time.\n\nThe dates presented here are given as single-year but represent average net survival rates over a multi-year diagnosis period. Data here labelled '1999' represents average survival rates over the period 1995-1999; '2004' for 2000-2004; '2009' for 2005-2009."}}}}
