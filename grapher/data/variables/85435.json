defined as reuse of material in a production process that diverts it from the waste stream, except for recycling within industrial plants and the reuse of material as fuel.\n\"Recycling rates\" are the ratios of the quantity collected for recycling to the apparent consumption (economic notion of domestic production of the respective material + imports - exports).\nIt should, however, be noted that definitions may vary from one country to another. In particular, total amounts of waste produced, rather than apparent consumption, may be used in some areas to derive recycling rates.\nPoint of contact\nRole: Originator\nPerson: Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)\nOrganization: ----\nEmail: env.contact@oecd.org\n\nTemporal extent\nCovered time: 1980 - 2005\nGeographic extent\nCoverage: World"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"24":{"name":"Austria","code":"AUT"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"106":{"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZL"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"127":{"name":"South Korea","code":"KOR"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"}}}
